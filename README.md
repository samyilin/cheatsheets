# README

## What is this?

My cheatsheet for recording program-specific shortcuts or keymaps or
command-line arguments and the like. 

I don't have decade-old muscle-memory for many programs and tools. Hence
why this repo. 

What separates humans from animals? Animals have instincts to drive much
of their behaviour, but human skills are mostly acquired and memorized.
Therefore, there needs to be some kind of documentation to help us
memorize things that would otherwise be forgotten. 

## Goals? 

1. Record things or websites that are very useful. 

2. Record my thoughts regarding programs or tools. Note to self: This is
   NOT A BLOG! Just so that I could recall my trains of thought. 

   I love the idea of setting up a blog, but this is not the place to do
   so. I consider GitHub to be a place for code and quick tools, not
   blogging. If I had time to do that, it would involve actually setting
   up a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based blogging website hosted in a
   cloud-provider or VPS provider somewhere.

3. Try not to be highly opinionated. This is difficult given point 2,
   but still needed. 

4. Try to use URLs that give far better explanations.

5. Try to stay on topic and make these entries not to fragmented.

6. This is NOT a [zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/),
   but a minor knowledge base.
## Project Structure

Programs/tools will be categorized into categories based on type of
programs.

## Why have a license at all?

I don't really care about it, but some may feel more comfortable if I
include one.
